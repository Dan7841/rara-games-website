    <section class="overview">
      <p>
        A dual-character roguelite adventure where two cursed lizard wizards fight, puzzle, and platform their way through a shifting, time warped lost city. Play solo or co-op. Survive the curse. Break the loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tomebound is a roguelite dungeon crawler that fuses tactical combat, environmental puzzle-solving, and light platforming, built for both solo and local co-op play.

      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>
        Bound together by a cursed tome, two rival lizard wizards are trapped in a looping, reality-warped lost city. Each run reshapes the journey into a unique district experience — from combat-heavy Battlegrounds and time-pressured Gauntlets, to puzzle-filled Observatories and treasure-packed Treasuries — ending with a district boss that tests everything you've picked up along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Master both wizards, switch between them in single-player or coordinate in couch co-op. Collect powerful upgrades mid-run, unlock permanent boons between runs, and discover new tactical synergies as you delve deeper into the temple’s mysteries.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a focus on thoughtful planning, mechanical variety, and character-driven humour, Tomebound offers a fresh, replayable roguelite experience where teamwork is always at the core — even when you’re alone.
